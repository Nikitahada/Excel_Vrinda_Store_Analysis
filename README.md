# Excel_Vrinda_Store_Analysis
I have created an interactive excel dashboard using data of Vrinda Store. The dataset did not require much cleaning. The Analysis mainly is done using Pivot Table and Charts. 
Entire process included Data Cleaning, Data Processing, Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Reports.
Insights inferred:1. Most of the sales were generated in the month of march 2. Women shopped more than men. 3. Most of the items were successfullly delivered. 4. Top 5 States where sales were highest 5. Adults (women) are shopping the most. 6. Amazon is giving highest sales.
