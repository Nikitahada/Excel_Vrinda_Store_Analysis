I have created an interactive excel dashboard using data of Vrinda Store. The dataset did not require much cleaning. The Analysis mainly is done using Pivot Table and Charts.
Insights inferred:1. Most of the sales were generated in the month of march 2. Women shopped more than men. 3. Most of the items were successfullly delivered. 4. Top 5 States 5. Adults (women) are shopping the most. 6. Amazon is giving highest sales.
